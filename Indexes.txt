Indexes:

Ares used to speed up querys

Is a POINTER to data and a table

An index in a database is very similar to a index in the back of a book

Is used to find data more quickly and efficiently

Users do not see indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries

Only create indexes on columns (and tables) that will be frequently searched against


EXAMPLE:

CREATE INDEX CIndex ON customers(lastName);

SELECT city FROM customers;  //more quick efficient search

DROP INDEX CIndex ON customers;
